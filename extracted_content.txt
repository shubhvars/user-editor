within the assigned radius to check in or check out.  
If the owner has enabled the camera requirement, the employee will 
need to open the camera before submitting attendance. The system

--- PAGE 38 ---
 
 
 
The owner can set or adjust the employee’s marking location by 
increasing or reducing the allowed marking distance. The system tracks 
the employee’s attendance based on this radius. If the employee marks 
their attendance outside the defined area, it will b e counted as not 
okay. The system automatically detects whether the employee is within 
the approved radius at the time of marking.  

--- PAGE 39 ---
 
 
 
 
The admin can set customized working hours and location rules for 
each individual employee. This includes defining the employee’s daily 
working time, selecting weekly off days, and assigning specific remote 
working days if needed. These personalized settin gs help ensure 
accurate tracking and flexible scheduling for every em ployee.  

--- PAGE 40 ---
 
 
 
The owner has full authority to update or modify the attendance policy 
whenever required, ensuring the rules stay aligned with the company’s 
operational needs.  
f. Approvals  
The owner also has the authority to mark an employee’s attendance in 
case the employee forgets to check in. When the owner marks it 
manually, there is no need for any photo or camera verification. The 
owner can simply update the attendance directly without  any 
additional requirements.

Advance Payment (Accounts Workspace)  
 The Advance Payment project helps the Accounts team manage all payment 
related tasks in an organized and trackable way. Inside this project, you can 
see a clear breakdown of every task and its current status.  
From the top section, Owner can view:  
○ Total Tasks  
○ Tasks in Todo

○ Tasks Completed  
Below that, the Task Detail board visually displays every task category 
such as:  
○ Backlog  
○ Todo  
○ In Progress  
○ Under Review

Each task card shows details like the task name, tags (for example Payment, 
Advance), and assigned members. This helps the team check which payments 
are pending, which are already reviewed, and which have been fully 
completed.  
The section also includes filters for quick searching, sorting by priority, tags, 
due dates, and team members, making it easy to track and manage account -

This task gives a full snapshot of the Sub task  within the Advance Payment 
project. It shows the task’s current status, priority level, activity details, and 
progress.  
You can instantly see how many subtasks are planned, what’s pending, and 
what’s been completed. Since everything is currently at zero, the task hasn’t 
been started yet and is still sitting in the Backlog  with a Medium  priority.  
The account also highlights key details like:  
● Description:  Vouchers  
● Assigned To:  Team member shown in the icon  
● Created On:  1 December 2025  
● Due Date:  6 December 2025  
● Story Points:  2 
● Tag:  Payment  
● Project:  Advance Payment  
This view basically helps you (or your team) track exactly where the task 
stands and what needs attention next. Super handy when you’re juggling 
multiple tasks and want everything organized like a pro.

The module helps payroll teams:  
○ Define and manage different types of salary deductions  
○ Set rules for how each deduction is calculated  
○ Determine whether a deduction is taxable or non -taxable  
○ Specify if the deduction should vary based on Loss of Pay  
○ Activate or deactivate deductions based on organizational needs  
○ Maintain accuracy and compliance across payroll cycles  
Key Elements Shown in the Interface

information such as:
